 * This project is meant to contribute to the human community,
 * the community of mankind itself. 
 * Considering the Bible is among the oldest writings in the world,
 * and is the most read book of all human history
 * containing the wisdom of humanity from the most ancient times
 * and, for those who have faith, is the inspired Word of God himself
 * I deemed it necessary and useful to create a project
 * that would facilitate the usage of the Biblical texts
 * in the modern digital era.
 * 
 * My hope and desire is to be able to add 
 * as many different versions of the Bible in different languages
 * as possible, so that all men may have facilitated access to these texts
 * This project will always only utilize original source texts,
 * untouched by any third parties, so as to guarantee the authenticity of said texts.
 *    Deuteronomy 4:2
 *    "You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, 
 *    nor take away from it, that you may keep the commandments 
 *    of the Lord your God which I command you."
 * 
 * I have no desire for any kind of economical advantage
 * over this project, nobody should speculate eonomically
 * over the wisdom of humanity or over the Word of God.
 * May it be of service to mankind. 
 * While I wish this endpoint engine to be open source,
 * available to men of good will who might desire to continue this project,
 * especially Biblical societies around the world,
 * and I hope the Pontifical Biblical Commission,
 * I cannot however offer the source texts and the databases they are held in
 * for public access, they are not all open source, 
 * they are often covered by copyright by Episcopal Conferences or by Biblical societies.
 * 
 * I wish for the code of this engine to be open source,
 * so that men of good will might contribute to making it better,
 * more secure, more reliable, to be of better service to mankind.
